  <h1> It Works! </h1>
  {{--
    By default html Form only support method POST & GET, but if our route destination
    is DELETE or PUT or PATCH method we should pass _method: 'METHOD NAME FOR EXAMPLE DELETE' to the query string.
    But need to turn the methodSpoofing on in file config/app.ts by changing the value of
    allowMethodSpoofing property to true.
    Below is the example
  --}}
  <form method="POST" action="{{ route('test.del', {}, { qs: { _method: 'DELETE' } }) }}">
    {{--
      By Default Adonis Js will protect our form submisson, so if there is an unkwon user
      that submit the form, the user will be redirected to previous page before the
      route destination is called.

      But it will make we can't submit form, to allow submit form, we have to call
      csrfField function to create a hidden input text that will be filled by the csrf token.
    --}}
    {{ csrfField() }}
    @button({ type: "submit" })
      Click Ok
    @endbutton
  </form>
